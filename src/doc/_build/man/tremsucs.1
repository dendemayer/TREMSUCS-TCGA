.SH THE CUTOFF AND THRESHOLD PARAMETER:
.SS Cutoff:
.sp
The cutoff parameter can be used to replace the vital status classification
with a classification based on a minimum survival time.  If the parameter is
set, patients are assigned to a group depending on whether or not they survived
longer then the specified value.  In figure 1 an example is given for patients
out of CESC, HNSC and LUSC without any limitation to treatment. With a cutoff
of 8 years, 3 dead patients are grouped with the alive cohort (Figure 2).
Applying a cutoff of 5 groups an additional 7 dead cases to the alive cohort
(Figure 3). This parameter is applied before the analysis steps. It is possible
to apply multiple cutoff values to one run.
The alteration of the survival data of just a few patients can have a
noticeable impact on the overall outcomes, but it should not exceed the maximum
value of the survivaltime of the dead patients cohort, since then no change
would be propagated. To figure out an appropriate custom value,
you can first run the analysis with the default cutoff and refer to the
created report. Within the patient_overview section, the survival data of
the given cohort is shown. On the basis on the data plotted there, a second run
can be started with a custom cutoff of interest. Already created results will
not be overwritten but incorporated with the new ones based on the chosen
cutoff. The final ranking gives then the same aggregation as if both, the
default and the custom cutoff would have been started together, since the
default is always calculated and incorporated within the analysis.
The custom cutoff should also make medically sense, e.g., stating that an
survivaltime of one year shall be categorized as treatment success makes little
sense and would not enhance the significance of the final results.
.SS Threshold:
.sp
The threshold parameter facilitates a modulation in the validation steps.
Each previously identified marker, either a differentially methylated
position or a differentially expressed gene of each patient, is grouped
into the UP or DOWN regulated set depending on the mean of medians of all
values. In the following, the Kaplan Meier estimations for each of these
two groups are calculated. Incorporating values close to the mean of
medians might be detrimental to the significance of the survival
analyses. With the threshold, an upper and lower bound around the mean of
medians is calculated (figure 4) and patient\-data between those boundaries is
excluded from the survival analysis. Here, the threshold gives the
distance of the bounds from the mean of medians in percent of the mean of
medians.
.sp
It is advised for the user not to exceed a threshold value of 20
since it is unlikely to gain any significance for the survival analysis with
an exaggerated exclusion of patients.
.sp
In figure 5, the survival p\-values of the 10 most
significant genes for patients from the TCGA\-CESC cohort with the
therapeutic combination of carboplatin, carboplatin and paclitaxel
(combined) and cisplatin are shown. With increasing threshold,
incrementally improvement of the p\-value for ENSG00000204187 (emphasized in
red) is visible together with a higher difference of the life expectancies.
Increasing the threshold will lower the size of the data base for p\-value
estimation, which can also result in increasing p\-values. In figure
5, an example is the gene ENSG00000204832
emphasized in green.
